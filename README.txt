Purpose:
To create a website in which a user can input a gene of interest and have the server send back basic information on any genetic disease that are associated with the gene as well as links to further information.  The program will serve a similar (though severely stripped-down) functionality of both the DisGeNET project in Catalonia (www.disgenet.org) as well as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) project curated by McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins University.
